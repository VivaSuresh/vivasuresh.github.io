Hi! I'm a computer vision engineer at DeepWater Exploration (first one woo!!) who's passionate about computer vision and GPU acceleration. Besides just the classic Pytorch and python ML stuff, I love getting my hands dirty with low level C and CUDA code, and my favorite thing is to rethink problems with highly parallel solutions in mind. My next big personal project is seeing whether or not I can take a ViT-B/16 backbone and accelerate it by writing the CUDA and CUTLASS optimizations by hand. My goal is to beat TensorRT with fp16 compilation!! Keep a lookout!
