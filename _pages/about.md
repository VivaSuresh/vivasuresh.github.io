Hi! I'm a senior computer science major at UC San Diego who loves solving real-world problems with code! I've worked extensively in underwater computer vision, at FishSense, and data science, at Applied Materials. Now, I'm looking to branch out into different subfields of software engineering and learn as much as I can in the process.
